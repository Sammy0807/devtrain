                  Hephzibah Missions in April 2014 as a youth based social club and finally metamorphosed into a
                  non-for-profit organization now called DEVTRAIN.
                  The club which comprised of young people was established with a keen desire to assist and
                  equip youths with innovative ideas to excel academically. Realizing that youths have very close
                  ties with their parents in Nigeria it became expedient to include women and men on the
                  programmes of the club.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
                It is alarming the rate at which the Benue populaces have over the years left the decision of the
                leadership of the state in the hands of a few individuals. The passivity and high level illiteracy
                among the electorate in Benue State is one that needs to be addressed. A large percentage of
                the people in the state especially in rural communities and sadly even in the state capital,
                Makurdi does not have a Permanent Voters Card (PVC) and at such are not eligible to vote.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                In an online MyPVCMyPOWER Survey conducted by Project Beautiful BENUE in collaboration
                with iVoteNigeria (2018) a sample size of 240 participants responded in the survey and it was
                discovered that 28.57% of respondent have Temporary Voters Card, 33.33% have the
                Permanent Voters Card while 38.10% of respondents do not have neither TVC nor PVC.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Also from the analysis it was discovered that 11.11% respondents lost their TVC, 11.11% lost
                their PVC and 77.78% of respondents encountered challenges trying to participate in the
                ongoing Continuous Voters registration.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Thus, the need to enlighten and encourage the Nigerian citizens to participate in the ongoing
                continuous voter&#39;s registered.</p>              
                <p style="text-align: justify">It is against this background that Project Beautiful BENUE and iVoteNigeria is carrying out this
                  voter&#39;s sensitization campaign to reach the youth, women, traders and people living with
                  disability and albinos. The approach is to reach everyone with information on the power of the
                  PVC and facilitate them on how to obtain PVC. Moreso this campaign shall address some of the
                  misconceptions about electoral processes and introduce novel, positive and truthful ideas of the
                  soundness of the electoral process will be introduced into the minds thus restoring a new
                  mindset and perceptions in the electoral process in Nigeria and particularly Benue.</p>

                  World Environment Day 2018 presented an opportunity to facilitate Schools Campaign targeting adolescents and young people. It was an integrated environmental management and climate change education project that aimed at promoting awareness on strategies on how to reduce single use plastics and eliminate the hazards plastics cause to land and water creatures. Also it encouraged adolescents and young people to take action by reducing, reusing and recycling plastics for sustainable development.   
Reduction of human and industrial activities that lead to rise in temperatures and community actions has proven to be the sustainable and low cost approach in combating climate change and encourage environmental protection and preservation.
